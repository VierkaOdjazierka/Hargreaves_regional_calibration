Final Script to Calculate Reference Evapotranspiration (ET₀)
using Various Methods
-----------------------------------------------------------
This script demonstrates how to use functions from HG_func_RCI.py
to calculate ET₀ based on input meteorological data.

Usage:
1. Download both HG_func_RCI.py and this script (script_publish.py).
2. Save them in the same working directory.
3. Prepare your input CSV files (e.g., temperature, precipitation).
4. Customize the input paths and station parameters as needed.
